        The clock tower has a long and storied history. Built in 800 A.D. by the ancient Parkite Indian Tribe, is was
        originally used as a beacon for late-night buffalo-tipping parties. In 1865, because of its extraordinary
        time-keeping accuracy, it served as the world's first Corrdinated Universal Time clock.
