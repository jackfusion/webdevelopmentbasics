  <h1><u><b><i>Miles Per Gallon / <abbr>MPG</abbr></i></b></u></h1>

  The purpose of this program is to calculate how many miles per gallon a person can get with their vehicle. The program
  starts by asking two questions.

  How many miles are on your trip odometer?

  How many gallons did it take to fill the vehicle?

  There is also another check to make sure the value entered for both miles and gallons is greater than zero. The
  program also confirms if you would like to continue and if you do not continue the program then calculates the miles
  per gallon with all the enters.

  Based on the assignments this is from we are to
  <blockquote> "Use a loop to repeatedly ask the user to enter a miles
    value and a
    gallons value. Within the loop, accumulate miles and gallons separately. The algorithm should generate a display
    of
    prompts, inputs, and final output that looks like this:""

    <p>"Sample session:</p>

    Do you want to calculate miles per gallon? (y/n): y<br>
    Enter miles: 35 <br>
    Enter gallons: 1 <br>
    Do you want to continue? (y/n): y <br>
    Enter miles: 36 <br>
    Enter gallons: 1 <br>
    Do you want to continue? (y/n): n <br>
    <br>
    Overall MPG = 35.5"<br>

    "Provide a graceful response if the total gallons equals zero.<sup>1</sup>"
